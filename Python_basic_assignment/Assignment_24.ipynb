    "Conciseness: Lambda expressions allow you to write small, anonymous functions in a compact and readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved readability: By reducing the amount of code needed to define a function, lambda expressions can make your code easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Because lambda expressions can be passed around as first-class functions, they provide a high level of flexibility. You can use them to dynamically create new functions, pass them as arguments to other functions, and even store them in data structures such as lists or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of use: Lambda expressions can be used in place of small, one-off functions that you might have defined using the def keyword. This makes it easy to use them in a variety of contexts without having to write a separate function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better performance: Because lambda expressions are implemented as inline functions, they can be faster than traditional functions that are defined using the def keyword.\n",
