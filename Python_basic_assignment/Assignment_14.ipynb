    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. RGBA is a color model used in computer graphics that specifies the amount of red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) in a color. Each color component is represented as an 8-bit value, giving a total of 32 bits to represent each color. This provides a large range of colors, including the ability to specify transparency. The RGBA color model is used in many image and graphics file formats, as well as in CSS for styling web pages."

The four integers represent the left, upper, right, and lower pixel coordinate of the region, respectively.

For example, if you have an image and want to crop it to only include a region starting from (100, 100) and extending 200 pixels to the right and 150 pixels down, you would specify a box tuple of (100, 100, 300, 250)."
