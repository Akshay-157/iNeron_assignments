    "Flexibility: Logging messages can be sent to multiple destinations (e.g., the console, a file, a database, or a remote server) and can be filtered by severity level, which provides much greater flexibility than print() statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of concerns: Logging messages are designed to provide information about the running of the program, while print() statements are designed to produce output for the user. By using logging messages, you can separate the concerns of providing information for debugging and monitoring the program from producing output for the user.\n",

    "Centralization: Logging messages can be centralized and managed in a single place, which makes it easier to maintain and modify the logging configuration for your program.\n",

    "\n",
    "Readability: Logging messages are typically structured and include information about the severity level and the source of the log message, which makes it easier to understand and analyze the log messages than it would be with plain print() statements.\n",
